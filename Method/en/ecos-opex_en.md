####  OPerational Expenditures (OPEX)

#####  Hardware

Keeping old hardware instead of buying new one, reducing energy consumption and reducing used space in datacenters may reduce costs.

__Example__

The online travel company Orbitz has moved major portions of its infrastructure off Oracle's Coherence to noSQL Couchbase. So the number of nodes has been reduced from 400 to 70 and the in-memory cache size reduced from 620GB to 55GB.

__Type of criterion__

The hardware cost can be measured in terms of money if financial figures are provided by the IT teams.
Should the opposite occur, a score from -1 to 1 may be assigned to this criterion :

* 1 : free and open source alternatives require more hardware ;

* 0 : free and open source alternatives hardware requirements are virtually identical ;

* -1 : free and open source alternatives require less hardware.

#####  Security

Security is a key aspect of any information system. It can be measured in terms of money or qualitatively through security flaws discovery and fix time.

__Example__

According to French National Information Security Agency (ANSSI) :
"The use of proprietary technologies, stewarded by Extra-European interest, is a major disadvantage for the national sovereignty and security. As most other European countries, France has important technological vulnerabilities in that matter and the sole possible parry is the use of free software."

__Type of criterion__

The security cost is difficult to measure. IT security vendors report figures without disclosing the methodology nor the data.

Unless the IT teams are able to provide financial data regarding IT security, this criterion is assigned a score from -1 to 1 :

* 1 : free and open source alternatives are less secure ;

* 0 : free and open source alternatives security is virtually identical ;

* -1 : free and open source alternatives are more secure ;

#####  Lock-in avoidance and interoperability
Lock-in avoidance is possible thanks to the use of interoperable solutions.

__Example__

The Open Document format is an open standard and can be used by many applications such as OpenOffice.org, LibreOffice, AbiWord, Google Drive, Koffice, MS Office 2007 and 2010, NeoOffice or Sun Microsystems StarOffice.
Choosing a solution might impose Operating System restrictions. For example, MS Office is not available on Linux platforms.
Choosing an Operating System might impose processor architecture restrictions. For example, AIX is bound to PowerPC, Solaris is bound to SPARC and MS Windows is bound to x86.

__Type of criterion__

The cost of vendor lock-in or interoperability is difficult to measure.
Unless the IT teams are able to provide financial data regarding vendor lock-in, this criterion is assigned a score from -1 to 1 :

* 1 : free and open source alternatives increase vendor lock-in ;

* 0 : free and open source alternatives interoperability is virtually identical ;

* -1 : free and open source alternatives decrease vendor lock-in.

#####  Productivity

Productivity can be increased by switching to alternative solutions.

__Example__

PDF conversion is a native feature in OpenOffice and LibreOffice while it is not available in Microsoft Office.

__Type of criterion__

Productivity can be measured in terms of money if financial figures are provided by the IT teams.
Should the opposite occur, a score from -1 to 1 may be assigned to this criterion :

* 1 : free and open source alternatives decrease productivity ;

* 0 : free and open source alternatives maintain productivity ;

* -1 : free and open source alternatives increase productivity ;

#####  Availability

Switching to alternative solutions may increase application availability.

__Example__

Since it moved off Oracle's Coherence into noSQL Couchbase, Orbitz can now roll out changes to its web application without downtime.

__Type of criterion__

Availability related cost is difficult to measure.
Unless the IT teams are able to provide financial data regarding downtime, this criterion is assigned a score from -1 to 1 :

* 1 : free and open source alternatives increase downtime ;

* 0 : free and open source alternatives maintain downtime ;

* -1 : free and open source alternatives decrease downtime.

#####  Image improvement

Communicating about the switch to Open Source can improve the company's image. It may reinforce corporate values, like expertise, transparency, collaborative work, team spirit or sustainable development.

__Example__

Companies such as Google and Twitter are well known for their involvement in free and open source projects and cultivate their image.

__Type of criterion__

Image improvement is measured qualitatively. A score from -1 to 1 is assigned to this criterion :

* 1 : free and open source alternatives damage the department or the company's image ;

* 0 : free and open source alternatives maintain the department or the company's image ;

* -1 : free and open source alternatives improve the department or the company's image.

#####  Support

Because a solution is open source, many companies can offer support. The competition decrease prices while maintaining a good quality of support.

__Example__

Using free software allowed a French ministry to cut 90% of its applications operating expenses. This huge cost reduction has been allowed by issuing a public tender regarding the maintenance of more than a hundred pieces of software with very strict SLAs (Time to recover of 48 hours...)

__Type of criteria__

The cost of support can be measured in terms of money if financial figures are provided by the IT teams.
Should the opposite occur, a score from -1 to 1 may be assigned to this criterion :

* 1 : free and open source alternatives support is more expensive ;

* 0 : free and open source alternatives support is as expensive ;

* -1 : free and open source alternatives support is less expensive ;

#####  Licenses

Free and open source solutions don't come with license fees nor license management costs.

__Example__

Oracle's licenses fees are well known for its expensiveness while there is an alternative without license fees : PostgresSQL.

__Type of criterion__

The cost of license fees and license management can be measured in terms of money if financial figures are provided by the IT teams.

#####  Innovation

Using free and open source solutions can allow to create new goods and services and to innovate. Indeed, access to the source allows to start specific software development more easily.

__Example__

The hadoop ecosystem and the noSQL movement are open source solutions leading big data.

__Type of criterion__

The cost of innovation is difficult to measure.
Unless the IT teams are able to provide financial data regarding innovation, this criterion is assigned a score from -1 to 1 :

* 1 : free and open source alternatives are less innovative or stifle innovation ;

* 0 : free and open source alternatives are as innovative ;

* -1 : free and open source alternatives are more innovative or accelerate innovation.

#####  Quality of service

Free and open source solution can deliver a better quality of service.

__Example__

Orbitz has significantly improved the latency of its applications while ending weekly failures by switching from Oracle's Coherence to Couchbase.

__Type of criterion__

The cost of the quality of service is difficult to measure.
Unless the IT teams are able to provide financial data regarding the quality of service, this criterion is assigned a score from -1 to 1 :

* 1 : free and open source alternatives decrease the quality of service ;

* 0 : free and open source alternatives maintain the quality of service ;

* -1 : free and open source alternatives increase the quality of service.

#####  Continuity
The continuity of a solution and its data is essential. It is even more crucial under mandatory data retention policies.

__Example__

Using an open standard offers better guarantees of data reusability, even years after.

__Type of criterion__

The cost of continuity is difficult to measure.
Unless the IT teams are able to provide financial data regarding continuity, this criterion is assigned a score from -1 to 1 :

* 1 : free and open source alternatives offer worse continuity ;

* 0 : free and open source alternatives offer the same continuity ;

* -1 : free and open source alternatives offer better continuity ;
