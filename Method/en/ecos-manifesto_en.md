# ECOS Manifesto

##  Of the need of a method

The cost of free and open source software comes with a lot a of stereotypes. Indeed, free means both "for zero price" (gratis) and "with little or no restriction" (libre). To avoid this ambiguity, the distinction is made with this phrase: « Think free as in free speech, not free beer ».

Cost reduction often leads to consider open source. But to avoid surprises, possible benefits and economies have to be checked from the very beginning. Every single deployment project, even without license fees, comes with related costs.

A clear distinction between cost reduction and cost reallocation is very important. Financial aspects must be taken into consideration for any reflections on Open Source.

Having a method of evaluation of costs linked to the deployment and use of free and open source software is therefore necessary.

* What is the cost of this software support compared to the one already installed?

* What is the cost of change?

* What are the estimated productivity gains?

* What are the licenses acquisition and management related economies?

* What are the hardware related economies?

* What is the cost of vendor lock-in?

To serenely answer these questions and make an educated decision while managing the risks, it is required to have a method that allows to :

* compare the cost of ownership of proprietary software to the cost of ownership of free and open source software ;

* assess the cost of change ;

* assess the return on investment.

Those different points led Atos to design and formalize the method of Evaluation of Costs linked to Open Source (ECOS).

##  Of the need of a free method

In our opinion, such a method must be distributed to anyone under a free license. Only such a license is indeed able to guarantee the promotion of the free and Open Source movement, through :

* the possibility of the reuse of the evaluations by anyone ;

* the quality and objectivity of the generated documents, that can always be improved through transparency and peer review.

Hence, Atos decided to distribute the ECOS method under the GNU Free Documentation License.
