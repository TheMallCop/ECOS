####  CAPital EXpenditures (CAPEX)

#####  Urgency

Switching to open source comes from either an altruist or an opportunist attitude. The need of change can come from legal or regulatory obligations or from the obsolescence of the installed solution, that has reached EoL (End of Life) or EoS (End of Support).

__Example__

With the huge changes brought by Microsoft Office 2007 came the opportunity to switch to the OpenOffice.org suite.

__Type of criterion__

The need of change is measured qualitatively. A score from -1 to 1 is assigned to this criterion :

* 1 : change is not necessary or not urgent;

* 0 : change is necessary but not very urgent;

* -1 : change is necessary and urgent.

#####  Training

Switching software might require staff training.

__Example__

Database management system PostgreSQL training.

__Type of criterion__

The cost of staff training is measured in terms of money.

#####  Communication

Good communication is key to any project.

__Example__

posters, brochures.

__Type of criterion__

The cost of communication is measured in terms of money.

#####  Emphasis

Emphasizing on knowledge, through a wiki or a forum for example, helps a lot in making the transition to the new solution.

__Example__

Maintaining a wiki or a forum.

__Type of criterion__

The cost of emphasis is measured in terms of money.

#####  Additional work

Additional work has to be anticipated during the period of transition between the two solutions.

__Example__

Maintaining the two solutions at the same time.

__Type of criterion__

The cost of additional work is measured in terms of money.

#####  Expertise

The change might require expert consultancy.

__Example__

Expert consultancy on PostgreSQL data migration.

__Type of criterion__

The cost of expert consultancy is measured in terms of money.

#####  Hardware

Additional hardware might be required during the period of transition between the two solutions.

__Example__

Server rental.

__Type of criterion__

The cost of additional hardware is measured in terms of money.

#####  Data conversion and specific software development

Switching solutions might require data conversion or specific software development.

__Example__

Microsoft Excel macros to Apache OpenOffice conversion.

__Type of criterion__

The cost of data conversion and specific software development is evaluated in money terms.

#####  Verification and validation

In order to make sure the solution is working properly, it is necessary to go through a verification and validation process.

__Example__

Proof of Concept development.

__Type of criterion__

The cost of the verification and validation process is measured in terms of money.
