###  Define

####  Scope

The first step of the process of evaluation of the costs linked to Open Source is to define the scope of the study. It means choosing the different domains and sectors of the information system that are in better position to benefit from a substantial cost reduction, according to the extremely high price of existing solutions or because of the difficulty to maintain or improve a solution based on a obsolete and closed source component for example.

####  Time Frame

The return on investment is usually calculated on a 3 to 8 years term. This time frame must be fixed according to the context and strategic plan of the organization.

###  Collect

The second step of the process of evaluation of the costs linked to Open Source is to collect the all data regarding the use (like the criticality for example) and the costs (licenses fees, support...) of the solutions in the domains and sectors of the information system chosen in the previous step.

In addition to financial figures, it may be useful to interview the IT teams in order to clearly understand the needs and expectations.

###  Evaluation

The third step of the process of evaluation of the costs linked to Open Source is to evaluate different solutions.

####  Two modes of evaluations

The criteria may be evaluated within two modes :

* quantitatively, usually in currency or monetary unit, to measure the economic efficiency, the profitability ;

* qualitatively, usually a score from -1 to 1, because a purely monetary method would overshadow important qualitative criteria. The qualitative criteria are represented in graphs.
In order to have a clear view of the costs linked to Open Source, it is recommended to evaluate only 5 qualitative criteria maximum.

####  Calculation

The cost difference between the installed solution and the free and open source alternatives is used to measure the economic efficiency, the profitability of change.
In order to have a single score to compare two scenarios, it is possible to mix qualitative and quantitative results. This score, named ECOS score, is calculated with this formula:
ECOS score      = sum of quantitative criteria's value
                  x ( 1 + sum [qualitative score x weight])
where :
Qualitative scores may be -1, 0 or 1.
Weight assigned to qualitative criteria may be 5%, 10% or 15% depending of how important the criterion is, 5% being assigned to an unimportant criterion while 15% is assigned to important criterion.  
Example:  
Note ECOS	= 30 000 x (1 + -1x5% + 0x5% + 1x10% + -1x15% + 0x10%)  
		= 30 000 x (1 + -10%)  
		= 27 000 €C0$
